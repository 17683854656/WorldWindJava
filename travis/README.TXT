README.TXT

This folder (travis) contains bash shell scripts used by the Travis CI continuous integration service.

The scripts in this folder are named with a ".sh" extension to aid the Travis script runner (.travis.yml)
in its effort to ensure the scripts are runnable in the Linux environment even if they are authored in Windows.
    Example: chmod +x ./travis/*.sh
